# CrowBotforJava
HackGT project, can retrieve data for any Supreme clothing. Instructions will be printed out in console.

Add to cart (ATC) function not included, as I now no longer support this practice.

Make sure this: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json is installed.

Additionally, Supreme has become increasingly aware of the bot presence on their site and will ban IPs that make too many requests too quickly. Firewall could also block some requests, so there's no guarantee this will always work. An exception will be thrown saying that supremenewyork.com's IP cannot be resolved, if that's the case.
